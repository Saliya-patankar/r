Create a factor corresponding to height of women dataset:
R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data("women")

# Create factor corresponding to height
height_factor <- cut(women$height, breaks = 3, labels = c("Short", "Medium", "Tall"))
print(height_factor)
Extract five levels of factor created from a random sample from the LETTERS:
R
Copy code
# Generate a random sample of LETTERS
set.seed(123)
random_letters <- sample(LETTERS, 10, replace = TRUE)

# Convert it to a factor
factor_letters <- factor(random_letters)

# Extract five levels
five_levels <- levels(factor_letters)[1:5]
print("Five levels of the factor:")
print(five_levels)
Create an array of two 3x3 matrices and print specific elements:
R
Copy code
# Given vectors
vector1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
vector2 <- c(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

# Create the array
array <- array(c(vector1, vector2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

# Print the second row of the second matrix
print("Second row of the second matrix:")
print(array[2,,2])

# Print the element in the 3rd row and 3rd column of the 1st matrix
print("Element in the 3rd row and 3rd column of the 1st matrix:")
print(array[3,3,1])
Draw bar chart and histogram using Titanic dataset:
R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data("Titanic")

# a. Draw a bar chart to show details of “Survived” on the Titanic based on passenger Class
barplot(Titanic[,,,"Yes"], beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE, col = c("red", "green", "blue"), main = "Survival on Titanic by Passenger Class", xlab = "Passenger Class", ylab = "Number of Passengers")

# b. Modify the above plot based on gender of people who survived
barplot(Titanic[,,2,"Yes"], beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE, col = c("red", "green", "blue"), main = "Survival on Titanic by Passenger Class and Gender", xlab = "Passenger Class", ylab = "Number of Passengers", names.arg = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd"))

# c. Draw histogram plot to show distribution of feature “Age”
hist(Titanic$Age, main = "Distribution of Passenger Age on Titanic", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Frequency")
