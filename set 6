Find factors of a given number:
R
Copy code
# Function to find factors of a given number
find_factors <- function(n) {
  factors <- NULL
  for (i in 1:n) {
    if (n %% i == 0) {
      factors <- c(factors, i)
    }
  }
  return(factors)
}

# Test the function
number <- 24
factors <- find_factors(number)
print(paste("Factors of", number, "are:", factors))
Create a list of random numbers in normal distribution and count occurrences of each value:
R
Copy code
# Generate random numbers in normal distribution
set.seed(123)
random_numbers <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Count occurrences of each value
occurrences <- table(random_numbers)
print("Occurrences of each value:")
print(occurrences)
Use the Titanic dataset:
R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data("Titanic")

# (a) Draw a bar chart to show details of “Survived” on the Titanic based on passenger Class
barplot(Titanic[,,,"Yes"], beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE, col = c("red", "green", "blue"), main = "Survival on Titanic by Passenger Class", xlab = "Passenger Class", ylab = "Number of Passengers")

# (b) Modify the above plot based on gender of people who survived
barplot(Titanic[,,2,"Yes"], beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE, col = c("red", "green", "blue"), main = "Survival on Titanic by Passenger Class and Gender", xlab = "Passenger Class", ylab = "Number of Passengers", names.arg = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd"))

# (c) Draw histogram plot to show distribution of feature “Age”
hist(Titanic$Age, main = "Distribution of Passenger Age on Titanic", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Frequency")
Combine three arrays:
R
Copy code
# Generate three arrays
array1 <- matrix(1:3, nrow = 1)
array2 <- matrix(4:6, nrow = 1)
array3 <- matrix(7:9, nrow = 1)

# Combine arrays
combined_array <- rbind(array1, array2, array3)
print("Combined array:")
print(combined_array)
