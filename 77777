Create an array of two 3x3 matrices and print specific elements:
R
Copy code
# Given vectors
vector1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
vector2 <- c(9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

# Create the array
array <- array(c(vector1, vector2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

# Print the second row of the second matrix
print("Second row of the second matrix:")
print(array[2,,2])

# Print the element in the 3rd row and 3rd column of the 1st matrix
print("Element in the 3rd row and 3rd column of the 1st matrix:")
print(array[3,3,1])
Create an array with three columns, three rows, and two "tables":
R
Copy code
# Given vectors
vector1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
vector2 <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Create the array
array <- array(c(vector1, vector2), dim = c(3, 3, 2))

# Print the array
print("Array:")
print(array)
Explore the airquality dataset:
R
Copy code
# Load the dataset
data("airquality")

# i. Compute the mean temperature (without using built-in function)
mean_temp <- sum(airquality$Temp) / length(airquality$Temp)
print(paste("Mean temperature:", mean_temp))

# ii. Extract the first five rows from airquality
first_five_rows <- airquality[1:5, ]
print("First five rows from airquality:")
print(first_five_rows)

# iii. Extract all columns from airquality except Temp and Wind
subset_airquality <- airquality[, !(names(airquality) %in% c("Temp", "Wind"))]
print("Subset of airquality:")
print(subset_airquality)

# iv. Which was the coldest day during the period?
coldest_day <- airquality$Day[which.min(airquality$Temp)]
print(paste("Coldest day during the period:", coldest_day))

# v. How many days was the wind speed greater than 17 mph?
wind_greater_than_17 <- sum(airquality$Wind > 17, na.rm = TRUE)
print(paste("Number of days with wind speed greater than 17 mph:", wind_greater_than_17))
Sort a given data frame by name and score:
R
Copy code
# Assuming you have a data frame named 'data_frame'
data_frame <- data.frame(name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
                         score = c(20, 15, 18))

# Sort the data frame by name and score
sorted_data_frame <- data_frame[order(data_frame$name, data_frame$score), ]
print("Sorted data frame:")
print(sorted_data_frame)
Replace "data_frame" with the name of your actual data frame.
